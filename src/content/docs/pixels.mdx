Umami pixels collect data about how visitors use a site, such as which pages they view, how long they stay, and what actions they take.
Tracking pixels work by loading a tiny invisible image or script that sends information about a visitorâ€™s activity when a webpage is viewed.
This helps site owners understand user behavior, identify popular content, and spot where people drop off.
The insights can be used to improve site design, fix issues, and make the overall experience more effective.
