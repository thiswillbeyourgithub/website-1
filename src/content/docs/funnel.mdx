Umami Funnel helps you understand the conversion and drop-off rate of users.
By analyzing the funnel, users can make informed decisions to optimize the website's user experience and achieve better conversion rates.

The insights works by displaying the counts of users that reach each URL or event and the drop off rate from the previous step.
The funnel uses specific order criteria, which requires step completion in a required order.
The user may navigate to other URLs or events in between the funnel steps, but must complete the funnel steps in order to be counted as a conversion.

## Parameters

- `Window`: (required) Amount of minutes a user has between funnel steps to be counted as a conversion.
- `Steps`: (required) Sequential step conditions used in the funnel. Minimum of two is required to run the insight.
