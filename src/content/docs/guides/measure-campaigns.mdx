title: Measure campaigns
---

Whether you are doing paid advertising or email campaigns, Umami can help you measure the impact
and effectiveness of your marketing campaigns in driving business outcomes.

It's important to note that Umami complements your existing tools.

- **Paid advertising**: Continue to use your paid ads management system (such as Google Ads) to track paid ads performance, such as spend, clicks, CTRs, etc.
- **Email campaigns**: Continue to use your email tool to track email deliverability performance, such as opens and clicks.

## Step 1: Setup event tracking

If you send traffic to a page on your website with Umami installed, that page needs to be set up to track
events. This is a crucial step as Umami can track events on your website, which is vital to understanding
campaign performance. We need to know how many people clicked a sign-up button, installed, downloaded,
signed up, etc. There are two ways to record events in Umami: using the data attributes property or JavaScript.
For additional information on how to set up event tracking using Umami, please refer to the [documentation](/docs).

## Step 2: Add UTM parameters to your links

If you send traffic to a page on your website, the links in your ads or emails need to have UTM parameters
so you can measure which links, creative, campaigns, etc, are driving traffic.

**URL w/ no UTM Parameters**:


`https://website.com/`


**URL w/ UTM Parameters**:

`https://website.com/?utm_source=newsletter
&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sales`

Umami automatically captures the UTM parameters you have added to the end of your links. You can review that
data inside your Umami dashboards or build a custom [UTM report](/docs/reports/report-utm). Google has a free [UTM link builder](https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/) that
anyone can use.

## Reading the data

Once events and UTMs are in place, measuring the impact and effectiveness of your campaigns involves
reviewing the data inside Umami. There are two places to look: **Dashboards** and **Reports**.

Your Umami dashboard will give you a quick snapshot of which events are being triggered. Remember that without
filters, the dashboard shows all events across all pages. Click More (see screenshot below) to filter your data.

To filter your data to measure the impact and effectiveness of your campaigns, click the Filter link
at the top of the page, as shown in the screenshot below. You can slice and dice the data with filters to
understand which campaigns generate events.

Umami also allows you to build custom reports that will allow you to jump straight into the exact data view
you are looking for. These are the four types of custom reports:

- **Breakdown**: Dive deeper into your data by using segments and filters.
- **Funnel**: Understand the conversion and drop-off rate of users.
- **Retention**: Measure your website stickiness by tracking how often users return.
- **UTM**: Track your campaigns through UTM parameters.

When you log in to Umami, click Reports along the top navigation to explore and start building your reports.

## Example

Let's review an example of how to measure the impact and effectiveness of your campaign by using landing pages,
as sending traffic to a specific landing page is a very common practice:

1. The first thing to do in Umami is view metrics on your landing page by filtering by URL.
2. We can then use data filters to understand traffic via query parameters (UTM parameters) to determine how people arrived on the page, which links were clicked, and which email was clicked (maybe you have multiple emails in a sequence youâ€™re trying to track).
3. We can then use data filters to understand the events on the page. For example, has someone clicked the Get Started or Free Trial buttons?

You can then return to your leadership and recommend adjusting the marketing spend based on actual campaign data. Also, when you determine what is producing the desired outcomes, you can go to leadership and ask for more budget because you will have the information and data you need to tell them the precise return on ad spend per channel.

## Conclusion

Using Umami to measure the impact and effectiveness of your campaigns is a vital step in achieving
your marketing goals. By setting up event tracking and adding UTM parameters to your links, you can gain
valuable insights into your website's performance and attribute the success of your campaigns to
specific campaigns, creative, and more. With the help of Umami's dashboards and custom reports, you can
