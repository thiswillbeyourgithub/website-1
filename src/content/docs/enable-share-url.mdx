By default a website's metrics can only be seen by the account owner. But you can choose to make the stats available either through a public **Share URL** or through a **Team**.

## Share URL

Log into Umami and click on **Websites** in the sidebar.

You can generate a new unique share URL hash by clicking the **Regenerate** button and saving.
