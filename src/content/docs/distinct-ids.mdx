title: Distinct IDs
---

A Distinct ID is a unique identifier assigned to a user, either anonymously or when they log in.
This allows you to associate actions (page views, clicks, conversions) with a single user across multiple sessions.
For a more extensive way to identify a session, take a look at [Session Data](/docs/tracker-functions#session-data).

## Use Cases

- Properly attribute user behavior.
- Connect events across multiple sessions or devices.
- Identify repeat users vs. new users.
- Build out journeys and profiles based on user history.

## Usage

Add the **id** property to the payload. This property has a 50 character limit.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "hostname": "your-hostname",
    "language": "en-US",
    "referrer": "",
    "screen": "1920x1080",
    "title": "dashboard",
    "url": "/",
    "website": "your-website-id",
    "id": "bob@aol.com"
  },
  "type": "event"
}
```
