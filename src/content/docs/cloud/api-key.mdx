In order to access your data using Umami Cloud, you will need to generate an API key.

All API routes in the reference section are available in Umami Cloud using an API key, with the exception of some routes listed in the `Not Allowed` section.

## Create your key

Once logged in, click on the side nav dropdown then click **Settings**.

## Using your key

You can access your Umami Cloud data by querying the following address.

`https://api.umami.is/v1`

Just pass in your API key via a custom header `x-umami-api-key`

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```shell
curl https://api.umami.is/v1/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "x-umami-api-key: <api-key>"
```

## Using your key with API Client

Set the following requirement variables to have the API client use your API key.

```dotenv
UMAMI_API_KEY={Your API key}
UMAMI_API_CLIENT_ENDPOINT=https://api.umami.is/v1
```

More details on using the API client can be found in [API client](/docs/api/api-client).

## Limits

Each API key is limited to 50 calls every 15 seconds.

## Not allowed

The following API routes are not made available using your API key.

```text
/me/password
/users
/users/*
```

## Deleting your key

From API keys click the `Delete` button for the specific key to be deleted.

Once an API key is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
