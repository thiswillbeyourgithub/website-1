Umami has built-in reporting to help you gain deeper insights into parts of your data. With universal filtering, you can apply conditions across all screens/reports for consistent analysis.
Segments let you group users based on shared attributes or behaviors. Cohorts take this further by analyzing groups of
users over time, helping you track retention, performance, and long-term trends.
