Umami Attribution helps track the effectiveness of marketing channels, measures campaign performance, and identifies which sources drive the most valuable traffic.
By linking attribution data with traffic and engagement metrics, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance marketing ROI and drive sustainable growth.

The report works by choosing a URL or event you want to track attribution for and displays referrer, paid ads, and UTM data through a specific attribution model.
