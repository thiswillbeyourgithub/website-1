title: Enable Redis
---

Umami supports [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a caching layer for improved performance. For example, when
you send a request to the server, a website lookup must be done. The result can be cached in Redis for faster
lookups in the future.

Additionally, login authentication will be handled by Redis instead of using JWT tokens.

## Usage

To enable Redis, add a connection string as an environment variabled called `REDIS_URL`.

```dotenv
REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@your-redis-server:port
```
