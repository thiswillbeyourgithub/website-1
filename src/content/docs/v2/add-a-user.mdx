Umami allows you to create separate accounts so that you can host data for friends or clients.

Log into Umami as the administrator and click on **Settings** in the header.

The new account will have its own dashboard and websites separate from the **admin** account.

There are two possible roles for users accounts, **Administrator** and **User**.
Only **Administrator** users are able to create, modify and delete users. Regular **User** accounts will not have access
to the **Users** tab.
