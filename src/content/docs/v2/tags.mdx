Use Umami tags to group events under a single website, gather data, and enable various functionalities.

## Use Cases

- A/B Testing: Test different versions of a webpage or campaign to see which performs better.
- Group events to allow filtering and insights under a single website overview.

## Usage

Add the **data-tag** property to the tracking script. This will include the **tag** column in the payload.

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-tag="homepage-layout-a"
></script>
```

You can reuse the tracking script for different parts of your website, introducing additional tags.

```html
<script
  defer
  src="http://mywebsite.com/umami.js"
  data-website-id="94db1cb1-74f4-4a40-ad6c-962362670409"
  data-tag="homepage-layout-b"
></script>
```

## Filtering

From the website **Overview** you can filter on specific tags.
