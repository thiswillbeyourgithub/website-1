title: Revenue Report
---

Umami Revenue allows you to helps track financial performance, measure ROI, and identify which pages or products
generate the most income. It provides insights into customer behavior, helping optimize revenue sources
and improve conversion rates. By linking revenue data with traffic and user behavior,
businesses can make informed decisions to boost profitability and plan for future growth.

The report works by aggregating **Revenue** and **Currency** data across a specified time period.

## Configuring Revenue

To start collecting revenue data, you will be leveraging tracking an event with dynamic data. This can be done through [tracker functions](https://umami.is/docs/tracker-functions#event-data)
or [data attributes](https://umami.is/docs/track-events#using-data-attributes). The tracked event must be passed along with the two dynamic data
properties `revenue` and `currency`. If a currency code (ISO 4217) is not recognized, the report will default to `USD`.

### Tracker function

```js
umami.track('checkout-cart', { revenue: 19.99, currency: 'USD' });
```

When tracking events, the default properties are included in the payload.
This is equivalent to running:

```js
umami.track(props => ({
  ...props,
  name: 'checkout-cart',
  data: {
    revenue: 19.99,
    currency: 'USD',
  },
}));
```

### Data attributes

Please note that revenue must be passed as a string while using this method.

```html
<button
  id="signup-button"
  data-umami-event="checkout-cart"
  data-umami-event-revenue="19.99"
  data-umami-event-currency="USD"
>
  Checkout
</button>
```

## Parameters

- `Website`: (required) The website you want to run the report on.
