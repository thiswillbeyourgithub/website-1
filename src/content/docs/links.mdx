Umami links monitor and record clicks on specific URLs to show where visitors come from and how they interact with your links. It works by adding a redirect link that captures metrics and data at the time of click.
This helps businesses measure campaign performance, identify high-performing channels, and optimize marketing efforts for better conversions.

## Add a link

Log into Umami and click on **Links** in the sidebar.
